            <h2>My interest in IT</h2>
            <div class="IT-interest">

              <p>My interest is a blend of multiple aspects which encompass our technological driven world. From a personal, user experience standpoint (phone, email, computer etc.) I’ve always had an appeal for technology which focuses on convenience or ‘ease of life’. An example of an application I use every day is Bitwarden; it is an open-source, password management service, which provides both convenience and security in a neatly designed interface. Most recently I have been intrigued by specialised fields such as programming, learning a few basics in Python, and dabbling in VBA.</p>
                <p>Overall, technology use has had a place in my life for as long as I can remember, and I believe learning it in a more formal setting will allow me to dive deeper into that interest, hopefully expanding my mind, unlocking my potential whilst revealing what is truly capable in a technologically driven world.</p>

            <h2>The beginnings of my growing interest</h2>
            <div class="IT-begin">

              <p>My passion for IT really ramped up the last one to two years due to both my experiences with a mentor, and observing the trajectory of the banking industry. My most recent Team Leader absolutely was the initiator for it. It began with observing his proficiency with excel, VBA and html (to name a few) and ended with me working alongside him on many projects, truly opening my eyes as to what was capable with even a small amount of coding expertise. I began to personally incorporate excel to more efficiently complete tasks and to create useful tools and synthesize sets of data.</p>
              <p>As an extension of the above, I began to view my own situation through a different lens. Currently I work in banking and there is a clear direction the industry is heading towards. With the emergence of many online only neobanks (e.g. 86 400, Up Bank, Xinja) and their focus on developing superbly designed iOS and android banking applications; to the ‘big 4’ banks increasing emphasis on technological infrastructural driven improvements - from automation of processes, machine learning, web development etc. it made it clear to me that I needed to keep up with this fast moving trend, I needed to take my career to the next level and hopefully be set myself up for the future with a well rounded skillset which could be easily transferrable to different jobs, industries and companies.</p>

            <h2>My IT Experience</h2>
                <div class="IT-experience">
                  <p>Despite my parents who probably think I am <i>some IT wizard</i>, I still consider my IT experience minimal, at least if I were to consider any aspect at a 'mastery' level. Aside from day to day use of iPhone, my Dell work laptop and my home desktop; I’m proficient with most widely used software windows-based software such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, etc, as well as having basic knowledge of excel, with limited use of excel functions (e.g countif, vlookup, ). Additionally, I have learnt a little Python (mainly through Udemy, EDX, Youtube etc.), as well as HTML through <i>introduction to IT at RMIT.</i></p>

            <h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
              <div class="IT-RMIT">
                <p>These thoughts of focused learning within I.T have been ongoing for a while, therefore one day I was browsing through Open Universities Australia (OUSA) courses and came across two that gained my initial intrigue; RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology and UniSA’s I.T and Data Analytics Degree. Within five to ten minutes a representative called me. I discussed with him what my current thoughts, explaining my observation on the banking industry’s shift towards technology, and what options I was considering. The OUA advisor personally recommended a bachelor of I.T through RMIT due to the university’s stellar reputation in technology fields (no surprise considering its name Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology), and it’s applicability to my own personal circumstance.

              <h2>What do I expect to learn?</h2>
                <div class="IT-learn">
                  <p>I expect to learn what particular field/subset of I.T and programming I’m most drawn towards. Right now I’m very much neophyte, I have really had limited work experience, where most of the time it was excel use out of necessity; built for a specific banking purpose, such as basic data analysis or a 'checklist-type tool' for other banker's to utilise. In short, I’m not too sure what my ‘calling’ is. </p>
                  <p>Additionally, I seek to build a rock-solid foundation in programming, familiarising myself with key concepts like variables, loops, sequences, arrays, functions etc. As I progress further within the course, hopefully I’ll paint a clearer picture for myself as to what career path I’m more suited for, what programming languages I should aim to gain expertise in. Furthermore, through the course and interactions with lecturers/tutors/other students, hopefully I can pick electives that will assist my overall goal as well (discrete mathematics? Propositional logic?). </p>

                  <div class="IT-job">
                    <p>Honestly this is a difficult question to answer, as mentioned previously I am hoping this degree will me find clarity and direction. Although, I currently work in finance and it might seem a natural choice would be a business analyst or a similar role, I believe my interest lies more in the web development/app development side. With that in mind, I believe right now a good, far to reach goal would be to become a <i>full stack developer</i>, as it encompasses both expertise in the front and back end. Through learning client and server software, it may reveal where my interest lies most, and I have a general affinity for.</p>

                      <h4>The results of the <u><a href="https://jupiter-34.appspot.com/"> MBTI Test</a></u></h4>
                      <img src="./assets/images/mbti-2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                      <h4>The results of the <u><a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/58a70606a835c400c8b38e84"> Big Five Personality Test</a></u></h4>
                      <img src="./assets/images/big5-1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

                    </br><img src="./assets/images/edu-1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                      <h4>What do the results of this test mean to me?</h4>
                      <p>Honestly, from a learning perspective, not much as I am aware I learn primarily through Visuals and secondarily kinaesthetically. With the behavioural based tests MBTI & Big five, particulary the latter, it really highlighted specific aspects of myself which I didn't realise I had a propensity towards (e.g. Openness to Experience) and areas I didn't expect to have a neutrality for (such as conscientiousness). I will highlight though, both have me weighted more towards introversion rather than extraversion, it isn't a big difference, which makes complete sense, as my communication skills have really been honed from years in the workforce where face to face, email and phone interactions were a proportion of my day to day activities.</p>
                      <h4>How may they influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
                      <p>My results (in particular from the big five test) show that I am well suited to a team based environment, particularly with scores in conscientiousness, agreeableness, however do note that I tend to have introverted tendencies, plus can have difficulty with maintaining self-discipline and motivation (please see <u><a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/58a70606a835c400c8b38e84">this link</a></u> for more information). This may indicate that there will be times I do not initiate conversation/action, and that I may procrastinate when I should be more productive.
                      <h4>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
                      <p>I believe awareness of the aforementioned neutral/weaker aspects of my personality is key to optimising the team experience. Whilst the results indicate I am suited to team-based activites, they also suggest I fit best with an individual who is upbeat, energetic and motivating. This means when forming a team I should be clear about these aspects in the beginning, build open it with the right personalitles, so the right combination can be formulated for success.</p>
